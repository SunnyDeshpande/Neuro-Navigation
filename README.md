# Neuro-Navigation
A Convolutional Neural Network-Based Navigation method using RGB-Depth images and odometry data

Navigation of on indoor environment achieved using a Convolutional Neural Network trained on the ROS move_base package and associated RGB-D images. This neuro-navigation method is able to detect and react to overhangs and small bumps in the field of view of RGB-D cameras. It has been trained and validated in an indoor environment with various obstacles.
